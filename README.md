In the Java programming language, a class and object are important concepts to understand if you want to know how object-oriented programming works. A class can be referred to as a blueprint or a template for describing the attributes and behaviors of an object. A class will describe the attributes (fields) and the methods (functions) that objects that are created from it will have; a class describes what kinds of data can be stored by an object and what operations that object can perform; a class does not describe any object by itself. For example, a class may define a "Car" by saying every car has a make, a model, and a year, and every car is able to display its information. A class is not a car; it is a description of what a car should be.
An object, on the other hand, is a specific instance of a class. When you create an object from a class, you are creating an object that has specific values for the attributes defined by the class, and an object that is able to perform actions through its methods. For example, maybe our object of class Car will have a make of "Toyota", a model of "Camry", and a year of "2022". This object now models a real car with those specific characteristics. We can create another object from the same class with different values, such as a 2021 "Honda Civic". Although both objects are based on the same class, the particular data within each object is unique.
The important conceptual distinction is that a class tells you how an object looks and acts; an object is the instantiated thing that contains data and can execute tasks. A class is general and abstract; an object is specific and concrete. A class can not exist without an object, and an object has no representation in the real world without a class.
